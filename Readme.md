# Voltammetry Data Processor (Kavanagh Lab, QUB)

A handy GUI-based tool developed by the **Kavanagh Lab at Queenâ€™s University Belfast** for quick and flexible processing of voltammetric data.

Whether you're working with **cyclic voltammetry**, **linear sweep**, or **rotating disk experiments**, this application allows you to:
- Import `.txt` or `.csv` files using custom delimiters (tab, comma, semicolon, space)
- Plot data using either:
  - Common voltage ranges (shared x-axis)
  - Individual voltage ranges (independent x-axes)
- Export results to Excel:
  - Single worksheet (with voltage/current pairs for each scan)
  - Multiple worksheets (one per scan)
- View clean, automatic plots of your data using `matplotlib`

The tool is built using `Tkinter`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib`. No coding knowledge required.
